    <h3>DIET TO FOLLOW:</h3>
    <p2>1. GET ENOUGH CALCIUM AND VITAMIN-D: Both calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. Make sure to include calcium-rich foods such as dairy products, leafy green vegetables, and nuts in your diet. Vitamin D can be obtained from sunlight or from dietary sources such as fatty fish, egg yolks, and fortified foods.<br>
      2. EXERCISE REGULARLY: Weight-bearing exercises such as walking, jogging, and weight lifting can help increase bone density and strength.<br>
      3. QUIT SMOKING: Smoking has been linked to decreased bone density and an increased risk of fractures.<br>
      4. LIMIT ALCOHOL INTAKE: Drinking too much alcohol can interfere with the body's ability to absorb calcium and may lead to bone loss.<br>
      5. REDUCE CAFFEINE INTAKE: High caffeine intake has been associated with decreased calcium absorption and increased calcium loss from the body.<br>
       6. GET ENOUGH SLEEP: Adequate sleep is essential for bone health. Lack of sleep has been linked to decreased bone density.<br>
       7. MANAGE STRESS: Chronic stress can interfere with the body's ability to absorb calcium and may lead to bone loss.</p2>

        <h3>PRECAUTIONS/PREVENTIONS TO TAKE:</h3>
        <p1> 1. THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM IN YOUR DIET: A diet low in calcium contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.<br>
          2. TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL USE: Research suggests that tobacco use contributes to weak bones. Similarly, regularly having more than one alcoholic drink a day for women or two alcoholic drinks a day for men may increase the risk of osteoporosis.<br>
         3.EATING DISORDERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS: Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women. In addition, weight-loss surgery and conditions such as celiac disease can affect your body's ability to absorb calcium.<br>
         4. CERTAIN MEDICATIONS: Long-term use of corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone, cortisone, prednisolone and dexamethasone, is damaging to bone. Other drugs that might increase the risk of osteoporosis include aromatase inhibitors to treat breast cancer, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, methotrexate, some anti-seizure medications, such as phenytoin (Dilantin) and phenobarbital, and proton pump inhibitors.<br>
         5. GET REGULAR BONE DENSITY TESTS: Women over the age of 65 and men over the age of 70 should get regular bone density tests to monitor their bone health.<br>
         6.TAKE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID FALLS: Falls can increase the risk of fractures, especially in older adults. Take safety precautions such as using handrails, wearing proper footwear, and ensuring good lighting to reduce the risk of falls.<br>
