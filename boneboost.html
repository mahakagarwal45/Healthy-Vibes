    <p2 id="para2"><b>1. GET ENOUGH CALCIUM AND VITAMIN-D:</b> Both calcium and vitamin D are essential for bone health. Make sure to include calcium-rich foods in your diet.
      <h3> <b><text-align:center center>Good sources of Calcium</text-align:center></b></h3>
      <br>Milk, cheese and other dairy foods.
      <br>Green leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage and okra, but not spinach.
      <br>Soya beans.
      <br>Tofu.
      <br>Plant-based drinks (such as soya drink) with added calcium.
      <br> Add nuts and egg yolks to your diet.
      <br>Bread and anything made with fortified flour.
      <br> <h3></b>Good sources of vitamin D</b> </h3>
       <br> Oily fish – such as salmon, sardines, herring and mackerel.
        <br>Red meat.
        <br>Liver.
        <br>Egg yolks.
   <br><b>Fortified foods</b> – such as some fat spreads and breakfast cereals.
      <br><b>2. QUIT SMOKING:</b> Smoking has been linked to decreased bone density and an increased risk of fractures.<br>
    <b>3. LIMIT ALCOHOL INTAKE:</b> Drinking too much alcohol can interfere with the body's ability to absorb calcium and may lead to bone loss.<br>
    <b>4. REDUCE CAFFEINE INTAKE:</b> High caffeine intake has been associated with decreased calcium absorption and increased calcium loss from the body.<br>
      

      <div class="head3">
        <h3 class="head3"><b>PRECAUTIONS/PREVENTIONS TO TAKE:</b></h3> </div>
        <p1 id="para2"><b>1.THE AMOUNT OF CALCIUM IN YOUR DIET:</b> A diet low in calcium contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.<br>
        <b> 2. TOBACCO AND ALCOHOL USE:</b> Research suggests that tobacco use contributes to weak bones. Similarly, regularly having more than one alcoholic drink a day<br> for women or two alcoholic drinks a day for men may increase the risk of osteoporosis.<br>
        <b>3.EATING DISORDERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS:</b> Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women.<br> In addition, weight-loss surgery and conditions such as celiac disease can affect your body's ability to absorb calcium.<br>
        <b>4. GET REGULAR BONE DENSITY TESTS:</b> Women over the age of 65 and men over the age of 70 should get regular bone density tests to monitor their bone health.<br>
        <b> 5.TAKE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO AVOID FALLS:</b> Falls can increase the risk of fractures, especially in older adults. Take safety precautions such as using handrails,<br> wearing proper footwear, and ensuring good lighting to reduce the risk of falls.<br>
