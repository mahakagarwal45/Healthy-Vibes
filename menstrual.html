        <h3><b>HOME REMEDY & PRECAUTIONS:</b></h3> </div>
        <p2 id="para2"><b>1. Heat therapy:</b> Applying a heating pad or hot water bottle to your lower abdomen or back can help relieve menstrual cramps.

            <br> <b>3. Herbal teas:</b> Drinking herbal teas such as ginger, chamomile, or peppermint can help ease menstrual cramps and soothe the digestive systems.
            <br> <b>4. Dairy products :</b> This might come as a surprise to you but dairy products like milk, cream and cheese arenâ€™t recommended. They are high in arachidonic acid which can act as a trigger for menstrual cramps.
            <br> <b>5. Foods with a high salt content :</b> Canned soups, bacon, chips etc should be avoided because they are high in salt. The hormone responsible for menstruation already causes water retention and a high salt diet will cause a gassy, bloating feeling.
