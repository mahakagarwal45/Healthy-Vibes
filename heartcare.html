      <h2>DIET TO FOLLOW:</h2>
       <p1> 1. Eat a variety of fruits and vegetables: They are rich in nutrients, fiber, and antioxidants that help lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and prevent the buildup of plaque in your arteries.<br>

        2. Choose whole grains: Whole grains such as oats, quinoa, and brown rice are high in fiber, which helps lower cholesterol and prevent heart disease.<br>
        
        3. Include lean protein sources: Choose lean protein sources such as chicken, fish, beans, and legumes, which are low in saturated fat and provide essential nutrients.<br>
        
        4. Reduce intake of saturated and trans fats: Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats found in fatty meats, processed foods, and fried foods as they increase LDL cholesterol and increase the risk of heart disease.<br>
        
        5. Choose healthy fats: Consume healthy fats such as omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish, nuts, and seeds, and monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in olive oil, avocado, and nuts. These fats help reduce inflammation and improve heart health.<br>
        
        6. Limit sodium intake: Consuming high amounts of sodium can increase blood pressure, which is a risk factor for heart disease. Limit your sodium intake by reducing the amount of salt you use in cooking and avoiding processed foods.<br>
        
        7. Limit added sugars: Consuming high amounts of added sugars found in sugary drinks, desserts, and processed foods can increase the risk of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Choose natural sweeteners such as fruits or use small amounts of honey or maple syrup as alternatives.<br>

          <h3>PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE:</h3>
       <p2>1. Exercise regularly: Regular physical activity helps reduce the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, and improve cholesterol levels. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week.<br>

        2. Eat a healthy diet: A healthy diet that is low in saturated and trans fats, high in fiber, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce the risk of heart disease.<br>
        
        3. Manage your weight: Being overweight or obese can increase the risk of heart disease. Aim to maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular physical activity.<br>
        
        4. Don't smoke: Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease. Quit smoking or avoid exposure to secondhand smoke.<br>
        
        5. Manage stress: Chronic stress can increase the risk of heart disease. Manage stress through relaxation techniques, meditation, and other stress-reducing activities.<br>
        
        6. Control blood pressure and cholesterol: High blood pressure and cholesterol can increase the risk of heart disease. Manage blood pressure and cholesterol levels through a healthy diet, regular exercise, and medication if necessary.<br>
        
        7. Get enough sleep: Lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart disease. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of quality sleep per night.<br>
        
        8. Limit alcohol consumption: Excessive alcohol consumption can increase blood pressure and contribute to the development of heart disease. Limit alcohol consumption to moderate levels.<br>
