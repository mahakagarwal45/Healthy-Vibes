      <h2 class="head3">HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE</h2>
      <div class="head1">
      <h3><b>DIET TO FOLLOW:</b></h3>
       <div class="para2"><b>1. CITRUS FRUITS:</b> Citrus fruits, including grapefruit, oranges, and lemons, may have powerful blood-pressure-lowering effects. They’re loaded with vitamins, minerals, and plant compounds that may help keep your heart healthy by reducing heart disease risk factors like high blood pressure<br>
        <b>2. SALMON AND OTHER FATTY FISH:</b> Fatty fish are an excellent source of omega-3 fats, which have significant heart health benefits. These fats may help reduce blood pressure levels by reducing inflammation and decreasing levels of blood-vessel-constricting compounds called oxylipins. <br>
       <b> 3. PUMPKIN SEEDS:</b> Pumpkin seeds may be small, but they pack a punch when it comes to nutrition. They’re a concentrated source of nutrients important for blood pressure control, including magnesium, potassium, and arginine, an amino acid needed for the production of nitric oxide, which is essential for blood vessel relaxation and blood pressure reduction.<br>

          <h3>PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE:</h3>
       <p2><b>1. SALTY FOODS:</b> Sodium can elevate blood pressure. Many people eat too much sodium without realizing it.
        
        Processed and fast foods usually contain excessive amounts of sodium, often more than the 2,300 milligramsTrusted Source a person should consume per day.
        
        It is advisable to check nutrition labels and be aware that even foods people tend to consider healthy, such as vegetable juice, may be high in sodium.<br>
        
        <b>Examples of foods with high levels of sodium include:</b><br>
        
        Rolls and bread<br>
        Pizza<br>
        Sandwiches<br>
        Cold cuts and cured meats<br>
        Canned soup<br>
        Tacos and burritos<br>

        <b>2. SUGARY FOODS:</b> Sugary food offers few health benefits and raises a person’s risk of unintentional weight gain. It may also contribute to high blood pressure.<br>
       <b> The following are examples of foods that may contain high fructose corn syrup:</b><br>

Processed desserts<br>
Prepackaged meals<br>
Crackers<br>
Granola bars or other nutrition bars<br>
Peanut butter<br>
<b>3. ALCOHOL:</b> Drinking too much alcohol can raise a person’s blood pressure. Excessive alcohol drinking may also be an independent risk factor for heart disease.<br>

      </p2>
      
      <p3>
          <h2 class="head3"><b>LOW BLOOD PRESSURE</b></h2>
          <h3><b>DIET TO FOLLOW:</b></h3>
           <p1><b>1.MORE FLUIDS:</b> Dehydration decreases blood volume, causing blood pressure to drop. Staying hydrated is especially important when exercising.<br>
          <b> 2. SALT:</b> Salty foods can increase blood pressure. Try eating canned soup, smoked fish, cottage cheese, pickled items, and olives.<br>
           <b> 3.CAFFEINE:</b> Coffee and caffeinated tea may temporarily spike blood pressure by stimulating the cardiovascular system and boosting your heart rate.<br>
          </p1>
          </div>
            <div class="para2">
              <h3></b>PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE:</b></h3>
           <p2><b>1.PROCESSED FOODS:</b> Processed foods often contain high amounts of sodium, which can cause blood pressure to rise. If you have low blood pressure, you may want to limit your intake of processed foods.<br>
           <b> 2. HIGH CARBOHYDRATE FOODS:</b> High-carbohydrate foods, such as white bread and pasta, can cause a rapid rise in blood sugar, which can lead to a drop in blood pressure. If you have low blood pressure, you may want to limit your intake of high-carbohydrate foods and opt for complex carbohydrates instead.<br>
           <b> 3. FATTY FOODS:</b> High-fat foods can slow down digestion and cause blood to pool in the digestive tract, leading to a drop in blood pressure. If you have low blood pressure, you may want to limit your intake of fatty foods.<br>

  <h2 class="head3"><b>DIABETES</b></h2>
  <h3><b>DIET TO FOLLOW:</b></h3>
   <p1><b>1. GREEN, LEAFY VEGETABLES: </b>Green, leafy vegetables are full of essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. They also have a minimal impact on blood sugar levels.
    Leafy greens, including spinach and kale, are a key plant-based source of potassium, vitamin A, and calcium. They also provide protein and fiber.<br>
    <b>2.WHOLE GRAINS:</b> Whole grains contain high levels of fiber and more nutrients than refined white grains. 
  Eating a diet high in fiber is important for people with diabetes because fiber slows the digestion process. A slower absorption of nutrients helps keep blood sugar levels stable.<br>
  <b>3.WALNUTS:</b> Nuts can be another excellent addition to the diet. Like fish, nuts contain fatty acids that help keep the heart healthy.
  Walnuts are especially rich in a type of omega-3 called alpha-lipoic acid (ALA). Like other omega-3s, ALA is important for heart health. People with diabetes may have a higher risk of heart disease or stroke, so it is important to consume these fatty acids.<br>

      <h3><b>PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE:</b></h3>
   <p2><b>1. SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES:</b> Sugary beverages are the worst drink choice for someone with diabetes. First, they’re very high in carbs, with a 12-ounce (354-mL) can of cola providing 38.5 grams.
  The same amount of sweetened iced tea and lemonade each contain almost 45 grams of carbs exclusively from sugar. <br>
  2.<b> WHITE BREAD, RICE AND PASTA:</b> White bread, rice, and pasta are high carb, processed foods.
  
  Eating bread, bagels, and other refined-flour foods has been shown to significantly increase blood sugar levels in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.<br>
  3. <b>FLAVOURED COFFEE DRINKS:</b> Coffee has been linked to several health benefits, including a reduced risk of diabetes. However, flavored coffee drinks should be viewed as a liquid dessert rather than a healthy beverage.<br>
